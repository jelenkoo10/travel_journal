# My personalized Travel Journal

React made Travel Journal, which displays five most beautiful places I have visited. It consists of five Card components, which take hard-coded data I found on the internet from the data.js file, and display a card-like description of that place. One of solo projects on [Frontend Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).
